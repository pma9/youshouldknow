### Fire Plow

1. Make a groove in a long piece of hardwood leaving stopping short on one end
2. Put a wooden stick, aka spindle, in the groove 
3. Sit down and put the hardwood with the groove's end by your feet
4. The other end between your legs elevated with a rock
5. Add some kindling to the notch at the far end of the groove
6. Use a back-and-forth motion on the spindle to create embers 

> Kindling is easily ignited material i.e. shredded dry wood, cloth, cotton

### Bow Drill

1. Lay a piece of hardwood on stable surface
2. Make a notch in the hardwood
3. Get a two foot long stick that fits in notch
4. Find another stick, bend it and attach a piece of string to both ends creating a bow
5. Loop the string around the spindle once
6. Use a rock to hold the spindle at the top
7. With the bow perpendicular to the spindle, move it back and forth to spin the spindle

### Hand Drill

> Same concept as above but instead of a bow you will roll the spindle between your palms
