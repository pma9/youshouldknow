### Shadow-Stick Method

1. Find a straight stick that is at least 2 feet long
2. Insert the stick into the ground so it stands up straight
3. Put a rock at the end of the shadow cast by the stick
4. Wait 20 minutes or until the shadow has moved
5. Mark the shadow's new location
6. Draw a straight line between the rocks
7. The first rock represents West and the second one East
8. Thus by putting your left foot on West and right on East you will be facing North

### Big Dipper
(Northern Hemisphere)

1. Find the Big Dipper constellation in the sky
```
   *    *
           *
                *
                       *
               *
                     *
```
2. Find the two stars on the outer edge or big end of the spoon
3. Draw an imaginary line outward from the these stars
```
   *    *                 * <- North Star
           *             /
                *       /
                       *
               *      /
                     *
```
4. The North Star will be at the end of the line
